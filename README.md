# Mapper

This is C++ program that works as a navigational GIS with a fully working GUI. It uses the A* algorithm for pathfinding and utilizes the Nearest Neighbor algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem. The graphics have been developed using a course supplied graphics library and Gtk.

It utilizes data obtained from the OpenStreetMap project. 

## Note
